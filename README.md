# Machine-learning-projects
A portfolio of data mining and machine learning projects as part of my portfolio. The repository contains files that I have been working upon over the course of my consultancy work as well as contains my capstone projects at the University of Sydney. 

[Project 1: Advanced regression and feature selection techniques](https://github.com/fawad-mahdi/Machine-learning-projects/blob/master/Project_1_Advanced_regression.py)

[Project 2: Bitcoin's prediction using Time series forecasting techniques](https://github.com/fawad-mahdi/Machine-learning-projects/blob/master/Bitcoin%2BSARIMAX%2BARIMA-%2BMonthly%2B.ipynb)

[Project 3: Logistic regression on breast cancer dataset](https://github.com/fawad-mahdi/Machine-learning-projects/blob/master/Project_3_Logistic_regression_breast_cancer.py)
